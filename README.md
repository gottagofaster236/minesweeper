# Minesweeper

- A Minesweeper implementation in Haskell, which has a web interface (using Scotty for the backend).
- Both the model and the server are covered by unit tests.
- You can choose the field size and the number of mines as you wish.

## How to run
- Make sure you have [stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/#how-to-install-stack) installed.
- Clone the repository.
- Navigate to the cloned directory, open up a terminal and type `stack run` and press Enter.
- Open [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) and play the game!
- If you wish to run the test suite, execute `stack test` instead.
